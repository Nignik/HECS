CMake Error at Benchmark/CMakeLists.txt:6 (find_package):
  By not providing "FindHECS.cmake" in CMAKE_MODULE_PATH this project has
  asked CMake to find a package configuration file provided by "HECS", but
  CMake did not find one.

  Could not find a package configuration file provided by "HECS" with any of
  the following names:

    HECSConfig.cmake
    hecs-config.cmake

  Add the installation prefix of "HECS" to CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH or set
  "HECS_DIR" to a directory containing one of the above files.  If "HECS"
  provides a separate development package or SDK, be sure it has been
  installed.
